# Template to run OpenGL into Visual Studio Code
This is my template to run OpenGL in VSCode using cpp, with a MakeFile, using GLFW, GLAD and MinGW

# To run it
* You need MinGW installed and in your Enviroment PATH
* First Download Project and open the "OpenGL_VSCode" foler in VSCode
* Secondly Open the TERMINAL at the project in VSCode
* Then open the bin folder by terminal with "cd bin" cmd
* After that run the "mingw32-make" cmd to build the "launcher.exe" file
* Finally run ".\launcher.exe" cmd (created by the Makefile)

# HELP
For more graphical information, watch the "/img" folder and open "run_OpenGL.png" image to watch how to run your main.cpp file
